As for my mission, it is to pull design out of the pixel silo and into into business strategy, product thinking, and technical implementation — coaching teams to integrate AI from research and ideation all the way to "vibe-coding" functional prototypes and even production-ready apps.

        Areas of Expertise
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Leading Designers in Cross-Functional Teams
    </h4>
    <p>
        I'm a big believer in the power of cross-functional collaboration. The best work happens when designers build strong partnerships with product, engineering, data, marketing, support — even sales. Whether it's through embedded teams or simply stepping outside the design bubble, I encourage designers to be curious, strategic collaborators who can connect dots across the organisation.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Diversity & Multicultural Communication
    </h4>
    <p>
        Diverse teams make better products — but they're also harder to run. I've worked across cultures, time zones, and communication styles, and I care deeply about helping teams build trust and psychological safety. With a background in intercultural communication (and plenty of hands-on experience), I help teams navigate subtle dynamics and create inclusive, high-performing environments.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Holistic Customer Experience & Service Design
    </h4>
    <p>
        Design doesn't stop at the UI. I see customer experience as a full journey — from first impressions to support tickets to offline moments that often go unnoticed. Designers are uniquely positioned to step back and bring it all together. I love helping teams uncover blind spots, break down silos, and craft experiences that actually feel intentional, end to end.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Product Strategy, Research & Workflow Design
    </h4>
    <p>
        Switching between big-picture thinking and practical delivery is a constant challenge in design. I support teams in defining a sharp UX vision, building smart workflows, and making space for both deep exploration and consistent execution. I'm a fan of dual-track agile, lean research, and lightweight processes that free up energy for the work that really matters.
    </p>

    <h4>
        AI in the Design Lifecycle
    </h4>
    <p>
        I'm deeply curious about how AI is reshaping the way we design — and how designers can shape AI in return. I help teams bring AI into the entire design lifecycle: from user research and ideation to wireframing, content, and prototyping. Lately, I've been focused on AI prototyping — using new tools to generate functional concepts fast, test ideas early, and go beyond mockups. It's an exciting time to rethink how we work — and where design fits in the product development process.

                Anna was a great support to Pyoneer the product and a valuable team player. She helped us to define a sturdy product vision and improve the process to execute on it more efficiently. Thanks to her broad
