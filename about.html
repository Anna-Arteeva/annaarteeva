        My story
    </h1>

    <p>
        I am based in <b>Germany</b>, born and raised in <b>Russia</b>, educated in <b>France</b>, spent a year
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">surfing</span> self-discovering on <b>Canary Islands, Spain</b>
        and matured in <b>the Netherlands</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three of my biggest passions that can’t live one without another: <b>exploring</b>, <b>learning</b> and <b>creating</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>
        The beginning
    </h2>
    <p>
        My design career started deep in my childhood when I was cutting letters out of newspapers and gluing them into collages, long before I could read. I attended an art school from the age of 7 and made good progress in drawing, painting and crafting. Later I have discovered some abilities for maths and programming and interest for computers – unusual hobbies for a girl of that age.. These quite diverse passions did not make the choice of a future career easy. First I have started studying Fundamental Computer Science and Information Technologies in Saint Petersburg
        State University, and Fine Arts and Illustration in École Émile Cohl in Lyon, France. Meanwhile, I
        was financing my life and traveling with designing booklets and coding websites. That is how I found a way to combine my visual and technical skills.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Way to the Digital Product Design
    </h2>
    <p>
        The biggest advantage early in my career was an ability to code my own designs, that was 2-in-1, a great catch for small teams. Following my passion to design the experiences from the beginning till the end and keep focus on
        "the big picture", I gradually moved from a role of “designing frontender” to where I am now. I love guiding the transformation of row ideas into great working products. That keeps myself growing and using the maximum of my skills in various fields, like business, design and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I do not promote my coding skill too much anymore, I enjoy training them for personal stuff sometimes (like coding this site, every line is hand-written by myself). Most importantly it helps me enormously to design more efficiently and set up sleek communication with developers.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Craving for adventures
    </h2>
    <p>
        Every creative thinker needs to feed her brain with new experiences and emotions to keep it sharp and delivering.
        The history of my brain diet includes years of nomadic life, hitchhiking, sleeping on beaches, learning all types of surfing and a few languages, cycling on crazy long distances, having very strange jobs and sometimes..
        failing miserably. Now I have more appreciation of having a proper house and ability to pay my food, but I still keep pushing my limits once in while.

        Apparently I don't have photos of myself working.. Maybe it's because I am busy then
    </p>

    <h2>
        Questioning the status Quo
    </h2>
    <p>
        Probably this one makes the most troubles in my life. I tend to doubt every settled solution and decision made,
        try to dig as deep into the problem as possible and find the real reasoning behind everything. This makes me sometimes change my mind half way through, which is not always supported by people around. I believe sometimes it is better to stop reading the wrong book. On the other hand, I’m also fast to jump into new opportunities and just try it out.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Working efficiently
    </h2>
    <p>
        Structuring and improving the processes can’t be overweighted, innovation is made by lazy people! While might seem that creativity needs chaos and absolute freedom, in reality, it's rather hard to move far without having a clear plan, smooth workflow and good tools. And they also have to be questioned all the time – you don’t want to use an escalator to plans a tree, but probably won’t do much progress building a house with a
        scoop. I always look for ways do things more efficiently, back in 2010 it was introducing Dropbox for sharing files instead of emailing them after every update, now it might be building a design system, tomorrow
        training AI.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Focus zone
    </h2>
    <p>
        Many people who know me do not believe that I am quite an introvert. It’s easy to see why – it’s my built-in
        extrovert-introvert switcher. I absolutely love meeting people and spending time with friends, my travel
        experience and fantastic house parties are proofs to it. But I absolutely need my focus bubble to be able to produce anything. That’s why you might often see me working in the farthest corner of the office with my AirPods on or escaping to the nearest cafe.
