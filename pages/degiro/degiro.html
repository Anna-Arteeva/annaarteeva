    <h1 class="article-title">Part 1. <br>Research and design workflow.</h1>
    <p class="article-intro">In 2017 DeGiro Trading Platform became one of the five biggest brokers in the world and by
        far the largest in Europe, beating the competitors with lower fees and a huge selection of products. As a
        product designer I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the Platform and Trading experience and
        prepare it to scale. I am going to share with you the work I have done and what I have learnt. </p>

    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>In just 4 years
        DeGiro
        revolutionized the trading industry making it accessible to millions of people across the globe.
        The web platform (designed in 2013) and the mobile app (designed a couple of years later) struggled to keep up alongside the growth of the company. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The applications were not able to add any more functionality without ruining performance and user experience.
        They were hard to navigate, the code base became unmaintainable. </p>

    <p class="article-picture-title">
        The current desktop and mobile apps
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other side there is an impressive crowd of day-to-day users who entrust large sums of money in DeGiro. That makes the redesign project quite challenging — we can’t afford disappoint our customers’ loyalty.
    </p>

    <h2>
        My role
    </h2>

    <p>
        I have joined the company to help re-invent the platform and design a new sleek experience. Our team is rather small: Frontend Engineer, a couple of Backend Developers and myself; also we get some valuable insight from the Head of Product. While I work exclusively on the new design, the rest of the team has to split their time between maintaining the current platform and working on the new one.
    </p>


    <h2 class="article-subtitle">
        Design workflow
    </h2>

    <p>
        Over time I have formulated a design workflow that I have personally used
        as a starting point for this project, and kept tweaking along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is the summarized version and more details about each phase follows afterwards:

        </h4>
    </section>

    <p>
I apply this workflow on different scales - gradually zooming in from the big picture concept to a single feature design, jumping from the last step back to the first one, adding more details and verifying decisions made in previous phases. It's like an artist painting a picture - sketching the general shapes first and adding more details layer after layer (my fine arts education has proven to be useful in an unexpected manner).
    </p>

    <h2 class="article-subtitle">
        Phase 1. Research.
    </h2>
    <p>
        In most of the cases, we don’t create products for ourselves to use, it is meant to be used by other people to
        help
        them solve their problems. As “Jobs to be done" methodology claims, people hire your products to serve for
        certain jobs.
        The logical starting point would be to ask enough &quot; Why's&quot; to understand what is the initial Job that
        your product is hired for.</p>

    <blockquote class="article-quote">
        “People do not just buy products and services for their features or other attributes, they hire them to get a
        job done.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        DeGiro Trader has been around for quite a while, so I have started with investigating what are the user’s
        motivations, their main expectations from DeGiro Trading Platform if we can distinguish different user
        segments and their use cases.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Try it yourself</h3>
    <p>
        I have very basic financial background so it's quite a journey to understand the whole new world
        of
        trading and investing. I have started with learning about basic financial terms and principles, bought a few stocks myself
        to try the platform and to feel the experience of risking own money. I’ve been observing how other people
        trade using our platform or something else, analyzing the metrics that were available. Although I
        am still far from being
        confident with my trading skills, I learnt
        enough to distinguish few very different ways people use our trading app:

    <ol>
        <li>
            Some would buy and keep for a longer period, waiting for selling prices to rise - Investors
        </li>
        <li>
            Others would buy and sell hundreds times a day, gaining on price differences - Traders
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Obviously, these are completely different use cases, but people use the exact same Platform to perform them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To deep dive into this finding, I have sketched the most common user journeys for both of this cases. This gives
        a
        great first impression of how the product is used.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example the daily journey for long term investors would be like:
    </p>
    <img src="../../assets/img/degiro/current-most-common-journey.png" alt="DeGiro Current Journey" class="article-picture">

    <p>
        It illustrates that people tend to skip the homepage with irrelevant to them global markets updates, first they
        want to see they own results and then, maybe, go explore more. </p>
    <h3>
        Competitors research
    </h3>
    <p>Another great way to learn about the industry and the problem - check what the competitors are doing. I was
        talking to my
        colleagues and they would always tell me: “Look at X, they have great this and that”. </p>

    <p>By trying out competitors products, you learn even more about your own and
        definitely, find lots of hidden potentials you did not think about. And always look for differences, often
        similar product in fact aim to solve different problems or targeted to different audiences. For example, we
        target to people with a certain financial background and understanding what investing is about, so we should be
        conscious
        comparing them to solutions targeted to millennials or gambling-like portals. </p>
    <p>I think it’s important to stay in the observation mode and not to start generating ideas
        and wireframes immediately. There is a risk of choosing the wrong path without discovering all the aspects and
        possibilities. </p>
    <h3>
        Empathy for your user. Personas vs Jobs.
    </h3>
    <p>I have been always struggling to understand the use of personas in the design process. Alright, if I know that
        our
        the average user is an educated man above 40, how would it help me to design? And do all educated men have the
        same
        taste and a way of thinking? And what if we can distinguish 100 different personas we need to design for, would
        it add clarity into the process? I really doubt so. </p>

    <img src="../../assets/img/degiro/iphone-users.jpg" alt="personas vs jobs" class="article-picture">
    <p>On the other hand learning that people wish their money generate more money can help a lot! And it would not
        matter so much if we are talking about millions or few hundreds, teenagers or businessmen, Netherlands or
        Pakistan, everyone will want to have their wallet safe and growing. </p>
    <p>
        It might seem logical that you would design differently for 14 y.o. versus 40 y.o., but think more about it -
        teenagers love iPhone not less than mature adults. So I don’t like to focus on personas too much, the great
        product should be great for everyone.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="article-quote">
        “Great product
        should be great for everyone”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>
        Roadmap for 5 weeks, 5 months, 1 year and more
    </h2>
    <p>
        It always helps to have a plan!
    </p>
    <p>
        I prefer to start with a very rough long-term vision with a bunch of placeholders, but which would point out the
        direction the product and business would move towards. If it's not done yet, it's the time to talk to those who
        decide on the business/product/technical strategy and make sure you are all on the same page. The goal is to
        translate the business strategy into product vision.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step would be to draft of the shorter term roadmap, for our case it would be the first release of the
        new platform. </p>
    <p>Then I would split it into smaller chunks and plan for every month, week and day. </p>

       <h3>
        How will we release?
    </h3>
    <p>
        We should keep in mind that transition from the old solutions to the new one will be very painful
        especially for active and most profitable users. Nobody likes going out of the comfort zone, people will have to
        learn how to use the new interface, we need to retrain our support team, write new information resources etc. So
        this part has to be really well planned. </p>
    <p>The agile transition would be done in several steps: first, we introduce the new platform only to some new users
        who did not form their habits yet, from them we will learn and polish it,
        then make it optional for the rest. </p>
    <p>Carefuly elaborated onboarding would play a very important role in this
        transition. </p>
