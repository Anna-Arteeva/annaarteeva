        Should designer code, frontender design or we need a new function?
    </h1>

    <p class="article-intro note ">
        This article is work in progress. I put it here hoping that I find enough motivation to finish it very soon.

        Oh this is eternal question, google has lots of answers and still we see a huge gap between designers and frontenders and the problem does not seem to disappear. At least in many teams. Designers still blame frontenders that transitions are not smooth and the layout is broken on “the very rare phone” resolution. Frontenders beg for pixel-perfect designs that fits into their carefully build components library. Actually it’s not quite rare anymore to see a designer who has interest to touch code and a frontenders designing beautiful interactions. And yet it does not seem to be commonly accepted in the IT community. But let me start from the beginning.
    </p>


    <p>
        Hello, my name is Anna and I work as a Product Designer in a innovative but relatively small IT company. Titles at my previous jobs were UX Designer, UX Designer/ Frontend Developer, Web Designer and even HTML Designer. So I have quite a good idea about how code gets written. And yet I have taken a decision to step out from that field and focus purely on Product Design. The problem with mixing up Designer and Frontender titles is that you are never a good enough designer nor a good enough developer, it’s a full time job to keep up with the updates in both of this fields and the expectations are just too high.

    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s take an average team and see what is expected from a Designer and Frontend Developer:
    </p>

    <h4>
        Designer
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Get familier with the company, product, see which problem is it supposed to solve, which metrics you are supposed to improve - you need some business knowledge
    </li><li>Study your user/customer, design personas, then map out their journeys - phycology knowledge
    </li><li>Design the right hierarchy for the information you’ve got, make the meaningful navigation
    </li><li>Come up with the right and logical interfaces that makes is easy to navigate and convert well
    </li><li>Make it in N number of resolutions
    </li><li>Use the latest design trends to make it look hype and stylish
    </li><li>Write the copy
    </li><li>Design smooth and nicely animated transitions
    </li><li>Find the right icons, illustrations or just make some
    </li><li>Make sure frontenders do not fuck it up make it right
    </li><li>Go on streets and do some user tests
    </li><li>Analyse the data insights, A/B tests results and hit maps
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Frontend engeneer
    </h4>


    <ul>
        <li>Check how all those hype hundreds of hype JS frameworks works and choose the one
        </li><li>Set up your Node + Webpack + JS framework + css preprocessor environment+whaterver else come here environment
    </li><li>Choose a meaningful methodology and try to follow it
    </li><li>Make sure you are on the same page with backenders and you don’t have your html inside .Net solution
    </li><li>Build your product architecture
    </li><li>Engineer the logic of the task, make sure you have the necessary API’s
    </li><li>Translate the png/Invision proto/Sketch/video and whatever designer has sent you into code
    </li><li>Set up Unit and cross browser testing and test. A lot.
    </li><li>Make sure your code is efficient and the app works fast
    </li><li>Check if the data is secured and can’t be hacked
    </li><li>Keep up with the dev environment and browser updates
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Well, not every designer and frontender does everything from this lists, sometimes you see them working in teams, but it’s often the case in smaller companies unless they skip the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we see here is that expectations and requirements of a designer and developer are radically different and has not many overlaps. And they requires completely different skillsets and it’s a full time job to keep up with the updates in both of them. So what we see happening is that as soon as designer decides to step into frontend world, he is expected to learn tops of hardcore engineering stuff he has not much interest in, same goes for a developer, if you start making decidions yourself on pretty smooth transitions and decide how layout would adapt to screen, you will end up being responsible for the complete User Experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        it considered that the designer doesn’t do the job good enough.
