    <h2>
        The value of low fidelity
    </h2>
    <p>
        I always start with sketches on paper, not only for myself but also to discuss work progress
        with stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important that everyone understands that UX is not UI, and UI is not only
        about colours and buttons.
        It happened to me many times: I show a new feature concept that visualized in a way  that it looks like high fidelity and everyone pay attention to different details – that new shade of gray, unclear icon or typo in your copy, but
        not on the concept itself. Using low fidelity help you to filter unnecessary details and keep focus on what is
        important, even if you can’t wait to make it pretty.

    </p>

    <h2>
        Getting feedback
    </h2>
    <p>
        I believe communication during design process has to be as frequent as possible. Even if it’s not in the company
        culture
        yet, you should deliberately ask for feedback from teammates, colleagues who are in support and more. To be
        honest, I find asking for feedback from fellow designers the least valuable, most of the time they either
        have very narrow attention to visual details, either share more or less same thoughts as myself on the things we
        are
        making. The most valuable feedback I get from people, whos work and life views are different from mine.

    <h2>
        Talking to developers
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have got a little tiny secret weapon - my past frontend developer career. I used to code myself the stuff I
        was designing and although I do not do it that much anymore, it affects radically the way I
        design and it helps a lot. It’s not only about designing things that can be translated into code (honestly,
        everything could, the question is the with what effort), it’s more about making things efficiently and speaking
        to developers on their language. </p>
    <p>I try to involve frontenders into the discussion as early as possible.
        They can give a lot of insights regarding the technologies that can and going to be used, you can find UI
        solutions out of the
        box (no need to reinvent the while every time), and the most importantly (actually it matters for any
        stakeholders), involving
        people on early stages and listening to their feedback you make them being true owners of what you are making,
        they start loving the work you are doing together and it creates better working relations. I think that’s a
        mistake done by many designers - they just shoot their mockups to developers and expect those would implement it
        pixel-by-pixel. </p>

    <p>
        We are lucky to have a great frontend developer who is open to new ways of working and communication. As we have
        started brainstorming on the new designs early in the process, we have also decided to start developing (rather
        prototyping in code) way before we have any final designs.
        We began with implementing the basic responsive layouts, setting up the styles: colours, typography, spacing
        framework, then core components such as navigation, tables,
        sliding panels, legendary buttons and forms etc. After switching to more specific screens and elements, adding
        more details and liking real data endpoints.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Technical challange
    </h3>
    <p>Luckily, our current backend is completely independent and quite reliable, so for now we can just use the
        existent API’s and let developers improve them on their rhythm. </p>
    <p>
        But frontend has to be re-done completely. Currently, there are 2 independent versions, react web app for mobile
        devices and an old Angular application for desktops. They look very different and both have clunky interfaces,
        inconsistent design and, from frontend perspective, bad quality outdated code.

    </p>
    <p>
        The decision we made is to keep maintaining both old apps, do not invest too much energy in optimizing them, and
        develop a brand new responsive React App in parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quite a brave decision that has some pro’s and con’s:</p>
    <h4>
        Advantages of building from scratch are:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Keep costs down: </strong>Maintaining one app is easier then 2 or more. We could decide to go for
            web and native
            iOS and Android apps, but it requires a lot more resources as from design side, and even more from
            development. And often it’s hard to keep the same functionality in the longer term, some teams would always
            deliver faster than others. That’s what happened with our current mobile and desktop apps. So with current
            team size (one designer (myself) and one experienced React Developer), it’s the only way to go.
        </li>
        <li><strong>
            Keep consistency up: </strong>Agreeing on providing same functionality and consistent user experience across
            devices,
            we would be more conscious and critical of our design decisions. Keeping in mind mobile version while
            designing the desktop one would only benefit from the desktop one, you would question every detail and try
            to simplify it to the edge.
        </li>
        <li><strong>
            Future-proof:</strong> There will be always more screen sizes and devices, OS requiments will change,
            responsive version would cover them better.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Disadvantages:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Performance. </strong>Native apps often faster and have more functional perks, like gestures and
            access to the
            device resources.
        </li>
        <li><strong>
            Complexity.</strong> Developing and designing is much more challenging, more possibility to overcomplicate
            code or some screen
            resolutions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Why not Agile Transition?
    </h3>
    <p>
        We have immediately refused to transform the current solutions to the new one with a bunch of reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The quality of current design is very poor, having to fight for every change would make us compromise on
            everything.
            That would limit our ambitions to build something revolutionary and drug us back. And it’s simply hard to
            rethink
            the whole experience when you always have to think about the transition from the current (broken) one.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are too many (unexpected) code dependencies, hard fixes, outdated technologies used. Transition to
            something new would
            just
            cost way too much effort than building the brand new one, not mentioning that the quality will be definitely
            much
            better.
        </li>
    </ul>
